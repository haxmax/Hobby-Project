# Oxygen Generation using Economical Method
This is project is inspired by some videos from youtube.

Water Electrolysis : Seperation of hydrogen and oxygen.

This project claims to increase the oxygen level in blood after breathing some of oxygen which was generated.

Baking soda also decomposes into CO2. If you use NaOH instead you will get cleaner CO2/H2.
Do NOT use table salt unless you know you do as it generates Cl, which may be bad depending on your application.... Or good (it's a way to make chlorine).
From the information above NaOH should be used.

## Warning

## Some Queries Which need to be discussed

What is basic principle behind this technology https://www.alumni.unimelb.edu.au/give/fre02-give-gift-oxygen ?

In this experiment how Clorine is generated? How can be avoided?
